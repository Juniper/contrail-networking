# Welcome to the repository for CN2

These contents supplement the product itself with some open source CN2 deployers, guides, and configuration examples.

In order to make use of this, you'll need access to the Juniper Networks [CN2 product](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products/sdn-and-orchestration/contrail/cloud-native-contrail-networking.html) as a customer or [free trial](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/forms/cn2-free-trial.html) user.

## Getting Started 

The guides you'll find here supplement the [Juniper CN2 documentation](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/product/us/en/cloud-native-contrail-networking/). If you're new to Kubernetes, you may want to try the simplest deployment using [CN2 with minikube](https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-networking/tree/main/minikube). If you're more seasoned with Kubernetes, then you can find the right deployer here and install CN2 into your multi-node cluster or even a multi-cluster setup.

## Getting Support

Juniper customers can get support as usual through JTAC, but paid and free-trial users alike, and anyone with questions can drop by the Juniper Elevate [community for CN2](https://community.juniper.net/answers/communities/community-home?communitykey=33a620e9-dd0e-4df4-ba5c-200cbf73b292).
